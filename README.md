Muhammad — Medical Bioinformatics & Computational Genomics
🔬 About Me

I am a multidisciplinary Early Stage Researcher (ESR) specializing in Computational Human Medical Genomics, with a strong focus on deciphering the genetic and molecular mechanisms of complex and rare diseases. My work lies at the intersection of computational biology, bioinformatics, and biomedicine, integrating in-silico modeling, machine learning, and data-driven approaches to investigate disease-associated genetic variation and molecular dysfunction.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Medical Bioinformatics at the University of Verona, Italy, where my research focuses on neuro-informatics and structural biology, particularly the dynamic and functional impact of disease variants in CaMKIIβ associated with intellectual disability.

I am actively seeking research positions, PhD opportunities, and collaborative projects in medical bioinformatics, computational genomics, neuroinformatics, and translational biomedical research.
